## Notes/Extras

App design looks really good. A lot of attention to detail and it seems like you touched every part of the UI to customize it. Probably one of the best looking and detailed app this semester.

There's a lot of different features on this as well and that's great. I like all the little details like the smart day of the week selection. Those kinds of things are always annoying when they're not implemented correctly. Glad to see you took the time to implement those kinds of things.
