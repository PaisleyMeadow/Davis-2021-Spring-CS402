# Transcribe
## Project 2&3 - Davis-2021-Sprint-CS402

### Pitch:
**A health app built with you in mind.** 
Navigating your health, safety, and well-being can be difficult when you exist outside the realm of socially expected gender, with medical environments becoming stressful and alienating if you don't fit into your assigned-at-birth box. **Transcribe** aims to fit your expectations and needs, instead of the other way around, helping you to track and monitor important mental and physical health information, while also fostering community knowledge to help you feel more prepared and less alone.  

### Description:

Transcribe is a health and wellness app built for transgender and non-binary individuals.   
It has two main functions - an individual profile, where a user can store and track data about many different health factors, including medication reminders, pharmacy information, and body measurements.   
There is also a Transcribe community. Here users will be able to view details about common transgender and non-binary medical topics that have been contributed by other Transcribe users.  The goal is to build off the existing tradition among queer and trans people of community-based knowledge by making that knowledge more accessible and far-reaching. Everything is completely anonymous, and users can choose whether or not to contribute to the community knowledge base. 

<!-- 
## App Summary:

Transcribe is a medical tracking app geared towards transgender and non-binary people. In addition to the usual medical/mood/day tracking functionality such asmedication/supplement reminders and symptom/side effect tracking, Transcribe also features a "Community" aspect. 
Since information about HRT and other medical transitioning aspects is usually anecdotal in nature, Transcribe is meant to build off of this existing tradition, while also making this information more organized and accessible.

The app is currently a WIP, but below is a description of some of its planned functionality. 

_Note: It looks much less put together than my first version, but it *works* better. By that, I mean the implementation is much cleaner/smarter, and more modular, which will mean expanding on functionality in the future will be much quicker and easier._

### User Login and Registration

Currently, the login button takes you directly to the profile screen.
The sign-up button takes you to a registration form, which uses the [mailboxlayer API](https://mailboxlayer.com/) to validate the inputted email, and will eventually create a user account to be saved in an external database.

(Sorry the gifs are huge, my attempt at resizing them didn't work too well.)

### Profile

The profile screen is pretty basic at the moment. The medication tabs are implemented as fragments, which can are being created programatically from user input by pressing the + button to the right of "Medications."

The profile image in the upper-right can also be changed by touching and holding the current image.

### Community

The task bar at the bottom takes you to the community page. Here, community data will be shown, hopefully with the help of [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart), which is only partially implemented at the moment under the placeholder topic.
